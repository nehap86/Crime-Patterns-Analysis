# Crime-Patterns-Recognition
# Classifier Models and their studies using Machine Learning Algorithms in WEKA.

Built classifier models in Weka on the predictive attributes using the training dataset (for Crime Data) for four machine learning algorithms:-
* J48
* MultiLayer Perceptron
* SimpleLogistic 
* RandomForest

Tested the models on test dataset to find the most effective and accurate algorithm with highest performance.
